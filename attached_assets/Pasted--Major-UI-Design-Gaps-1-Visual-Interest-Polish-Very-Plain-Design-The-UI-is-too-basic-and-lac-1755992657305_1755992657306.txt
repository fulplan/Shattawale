ðŸŽ¨ Major UI Design Gaps
1. Visual Interest & Polish
Very Plain Design: The UI is too basic and lacks visual personality
No Brand Identity: Generic styling without unique brand elements
Monotonous Layout: All pages look very similar
Limited Color Usage: Heavily gray-focused, needs more vibrant accents
2. Data Visualization
No Real Charts: Analytics page has placeholder charts only
Missing Dashboards: No visual revenue trends, order patterns
Static Metrics: Numbers without visual context or trends
3. Media & Visual Elements
No Product Images: Just placeholder icons instead of actual photos
No Image Management: Can't upload or manage product images
Limited Icons: Basic Lucide icons, could use more variety
